What is a Content Delivery Network (CDN)?  List and explain at least FOUR advantages in using a CDN.

Content Delivery Network makes it possible to send files to multiple servers as opposed to just a single server. Four advantages of using a CDN are it is easy to link version control systems, faster downloads because the data center is closer to the user, files don't need to be redownloaded if they have previously been downloaded, and CDN files are stored in a different domain making it possible for the browser to download other files at the same time.
